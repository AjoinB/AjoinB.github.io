Ganja.js is a Geometric Algebra code generator for javascript. It generates
Clifford algebras and sub-algebras of any signature and implements operator 
overloading and algebraic constants.  

(**Mathematically**, an algebra generated by ganja.js is a graded exterior (Grassmann) algebra 
(or one of its subalgebras) with a non-metric outer product, extended (Clifford) with geometric and contraction inner products, a Poincare duality operator and the main
involutions and automorphisms.)

(**Technically**, ganja.js is a code generator producing classes that reificate algebraic literals 
and expressions by using reflection, a built-in tokenizer and a simple AST translator to 
rewrite functions containing algebraic constructs to their procedural counterparts.)

(**Seriously**, look at the [examples](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html)
or play [the wedge game](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/example_game_wedge.html) first.)
