WARNING: This is a clone of Steven DeKeninck's excellent ganja.js github site.

For an excellent tutorial and description of Geometric Algebra and how to use his code effectively, 
you should head over to his [site](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js).

If you want to burn my bandwidth, then go to my copy of Steven's examples [here](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html).

But I can screw those up at will, so you should probably head over to the [examples](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html) created by the guy that knows what he is doing.
