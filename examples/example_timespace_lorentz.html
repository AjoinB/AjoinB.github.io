  // We implement the example from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvEJat0T_Kw&gl=BE
  // in a coordinate free way. (without any difficult formulas .. )

  // In the earths reference frame, a tree is at the origin and a pole is at x=20km
  // Lightning strikes both the tree and the pole at t=10microseconds. The lightning
  // strikes are observed by a rocket traveling in the positive x direction at 0.5c

  // 1. what time does the lightning strikes take place for the rocket.
  // 2. are they still simultanious ?

  // The spacetime unit we use is lightseconds (for both time and space)

  var km = (x,y,z)=>(x*1e2+y*1e3+z*1e4)/299792.458;

  // Define two events in our own reference frame. (the earths)
  var strike_tree = micros(10) + km(0,0,0);
  var strike_pole = micros(10) + km(20,0,0);

  // Calculate the lorentz transform to go to the rockets frame.
  var rocket_speed = 0.5; // Half the speed of light.
  var rocket_frame = (Math.atanh(rocket_speed)*.5e12).Exp();

  // Transform the events to the rockets frame.
  var strike_tree_r = rocket_frame >>> strike_tree;
  var strike_pole_r = rocket_frame >>> strike_pole;

  // Output our results.
